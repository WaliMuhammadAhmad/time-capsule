        TimeCapsule lets you preserve memories and messagesâ€”then relive them
        when the time is right. Create capsules with notes and media, set a
        future unlock date, and choose to keep them private or share publicly.
        We designed this experience with a focus on simplicity, glassmorphic
        visuals, and subtle motion.
